## **U Arm / Tensioner Arm**

![U Arm Check](../u_arm_1.png)

- Check that the U Arm/Tensioner Arm moves freely from left to right. If you feel resistance, inspect the 3D-printed parts and remove any unwanted filament blobs. This step **is crucial** before assembling the gantry. Once you're satisfied with the movement, repeat the process for the second one.

- In this step, the M4xD5xL30 Shoulder Bolt is used as an **assembly aid**. It helps align components and will be removed in a later step.
- Using the assembly aid, install one 7x5x1mm shim, a smooth idler and a 5x6x10.5mm spacer.
- Repeat the process for the second one.

!!! tip
    There is no top or bottom side in this step, so both tensioners should look the same.
    **Check that both smooth idlers move freely.**
