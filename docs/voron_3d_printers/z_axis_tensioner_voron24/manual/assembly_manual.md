## **Get your Printer ready for the Z-Axis Belt Tensioner:**

- Move you gantry all the way down or secure it so that it will not drop when removing the Z belts!
- Once the gantry is secure, remove your stock Z Idlers and belts. You will need new belts, as the once installed are not long enough.

## **Install the Tool-free Z-Axis Belt Tensioner**

Install 3x Drop-in T-nut, M5 in each top corner. One in the Y-Axis and two in the front/back profile.
!!! Tip
    If you have Drop-in T-nut installed you can reuse them and just move and add one more per corner. If you are using M5 Hammer Head T-Nuts. Please change them for M5 T-nut.
