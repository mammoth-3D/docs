# **Printing Guide**

## **Primary Color**

Example: `mammoth Voron Z Idler Main Body Left.stl`
These files have no prefix in their filename so are safe to print in your primary color.

## **Accent Color**

Example: `[A] mammoth-3D Voron2.4 Z Idler_V1.3 A x2.stl`
These files are prefixed with `[A]` and are intended to be printed in your accent color.

## **Quantity Required**

Example: `mammoth-3D Voron2.4 Z Idler_V1.3 Tensioner x2.stl`
If any file ends with `x#`, that is telling you the quantity of that part required to build the Z-Axis Belt Tensioner.

## **Support and Drilling Out Holes**

No need for that :octicons-heart-fill-24:{ .heart } 

!!! note "Layer Height and Line Width"
    Some parts have supporting layers to allow unsupported features to be printed successfully. These supports are designed to work at a layer height of **0.2mm**, so they may not be sliced correctly if your layer height is not **0.2mm**.

!!! tip
    The "Tensioner" can be printed only once and you don't need to keep it on the printer. You will only need them to tension your belts. But can be removed afterwards.
