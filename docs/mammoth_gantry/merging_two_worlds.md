# **mammoth-3D AWD Gantry: Merging Two Worlds**

## **Origins of the mammoth-3D AWD Gantry**  

The idea for the **mammoth-3D AWD gantry** began in **April 2023**. At the time, **Voron 3D printers** were leading the open-source printer community, while **VZBot 3D printers** were pushing the boundaries of high-speed printing with impressive quality. 
This sparked a race, who would be the first to adapt and run a **VZBot toolhead** on a **Voron printer**?  

In **June 2023**, the **mammoth-3D Toolhead** was developed, allowing users to equip their **Voron printers** with the **Goliath hotend** and **CPAP cooling** for improved performance.  

By the end of **2024**, the **mammoth-3D AWD Gantry v6** was finalized‚Äîthe first version made publicly available, documented as **version 1.7.3**.

## **What Makes the mammoth-3D AWD Gantry Unique?**

Unlike modifications that adapt a **Voron gantry** to fit a **VZBot toolhead**, we **designed an entirely new gantry** from the ground up.  

### **Key Features**  

- **Cross-Compatible** ‚Äì Use either **Voron toolheads** or the **VZBot toolhead** on the new gantry.  
- **Expanded Printer Support** ‚Äì Now, **Voron toolheads** can also be mounted on a **VZBot printer**.  
- **High-Speed Optimization** ‚Äì Supports **30T pulleys** and **long shaft motors (5mm or 8mm)**, allowing for maximum speed and flexibility in component selection.  

By doing this, we‚Äôve effectively **brought two worlds together**, offering the best of both **Voron** and **VZBot** ecosystems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations Before Installing**  

Before you decide to build a **mammoth-3D AWD gantry**, please be aware of the following:  

### üîπ **No Official Voron Manual**  
While we provide **documentation** and a **Discord group**, our guide is not as detailed as the **Voron** manual. You should already be **comfortable assembling a stock 3D printer** before attempting this build.  

### üîπ **Most Existing Parts Won‚Äôt Fit**  
Your current **gantry parts** will likely be **incompatible** with the new design, meaning you‚Äôll need to **invest in new components**.  

### üîπ **Frame Modifications Required**  
The **aluminum profiles** have changed and will need to be **cut to fit** your new gantry. Detailed information is available in the **[source guide](https://docs.mammoth-3d.ch/voron_3d_printers/awd_gantry_vz_toolhead_printed_version/bom/awdvz_sourcing_guide/)**.
