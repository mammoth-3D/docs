# From mammoth to behemoth
## Engineering the Next Stage of High-Performance Gantries

![mammoth-3D Toolhead](./behemoth.png)

In 2023, the open-source 3D printing landscape was largely defined by two platforms:

- Voron — known for precision engineering and strong community documentation  
- VZBot — known for aggressive speed and high-performance motion systems  

Each represented a different philosophy.

**mammoth** was created to unify them.

# 🦣 Mammoth: Where Two Worlds Met

The mammoth-3D AWD Gantry was not an adapter or a light modification.

It was a complete ground-up redesign.

The goal was simple:

**Combine the structural precision of Voron with the speed-focused performance of VZBot — without compromise.**

## What mammoth Delivered

- True cross-compatibility between ecosystems  
- Support for high-speed configurations (30T pulleys)  
- Long shaft motor compatibility (5mm & 8mm)  
- Toolhead flexibility across platforms  

Rather than forcing one system into another, mammoth reimagined the gantry architecture itself.

It proved that performance and flexibility could coexist within a single engineered solution.

# Evolution Is Not a Version Number

behemoth is not “mammoth V2.”

It represents a structural shift in direction.

Where mammoth focused on merging ecosystems,  
behemoth focuses on establishing its own.

---

# behemoth: Designed for Independence

behemoth is engineered to move beyond adaptation.

It is the foundation of a standalone 3D printer platform — built with scalability, strength, and long-term evolution in mind.

---

## 📏 Built for Scale From the Start

- Initial platform size: **400 × 400 mm**
- Long-term development target: **1000 × 1000 mm multi-toolhead capability**

behemoth is not constrained by traditional desktop dimensions.

It is engineered to support large-format, high-rigidity builds from day one.

---

## 🏗 Transitional Compatibility

In its current stage, behemoth supports Voron printers.

As development progresses, the platform transitions toward **3030 aluminum profile architecture**, creating a stronger and more independent structural standard.

This ensures long-term scalability and mechanical stability.

---

## ⚙ Configurable Belt Architecture

behemoth supports multiple belt widths:

- 6 mm  
- 9 mm  
- 10 mm  
- 12 mm  

This allows builders to balance speed, torque capacity, and structural rigidity according to their performance goals.

---

## The mammoth Idler Pack — Refined Engineering

After a year of iterative testing and refinement, the idler system has been significantly improved:

- Direct access to idlers and bearings  
- No motor mount removal required  
- Belt tensioning through the idler pack  
- Reduced stress on motor shafts  

This design increases serviceability while improving long-term mechanical reliability.

---

## 🔩 Builder-Focused Flexibility

behemoth supports:

- Double-shear configurations  
- Traditional idler setups  
- Modular customization options  

The platform is engineered to provide flexibility without sacrificing structural integrity.

---

# The Strategic Shift

mammoth demonstrated that ecosystems could be unified.

behemoth establishes a platform that can stand independently.

It reflects a move from integration  
to long-term architectural ownership.

---

# The Next Phase

behemoth is not the final form.

It is the beginning of a larger platform vision.

Further features and refinements will be introduced in the coming weeks as development continues.
